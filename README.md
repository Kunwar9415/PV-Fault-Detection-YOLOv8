# PV Fault Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview
This is a working implementation of a PV (Photovoltaic) fault detection system using YOLOv8.
The project detects defects in solar panel Electroluminescence (EL) images such as cracks and faulty regions.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Google Colab

## Features
- Dataset preprocessing
- YOLOv8 model training
- Fault detection and localization
- Inference with sample outputs

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Install dependencies
3. Upload the dataset
4. Run training or inference cells

## Status
✅ Working project (end-to-end runnable)
